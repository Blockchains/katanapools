## Limitations and future work

- Currently the app only supports swapping of and creating pools with ERC20 tokens. Future iterations will support all networks supported by Bancor protocol.

- App only supports login via metamask, future work will make the app provider agnostic allow login via multiple web3 providers.

- Only 2 reserve tokens are supported for each liquidiy pool.

- Currently The app can be integrated into an existing web-app via cloning the project, installing the dependancies and importing the Landing component,
  future iterations will make this available as a node module.
